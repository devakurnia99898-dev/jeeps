## The Diagnostic / The Situation
The introduction of the Kei Truck in GTA Online has sparked a new wave of interest in drift-oriented vehicles. As a seasoned mechanic, it's essential to understand the technical background of these vehicles and the symptoms or signs to look for when preparing them for drifting. Drifting requires a unique combination of power, suspension, and chassis setup, which can be challenging to achieve, especially in a virtual environment.

## Technical Deep Dive
The Kei Truck's engine, suspension, and electrical systems must be modified to achieve the perfect drift. The engine should have a high power-to-weight ratio, while the suspension should be able to handle the stresses of drifting. Common failure points in drift-oriented vehicles include the drivetrain, brakes, and chassis. In the Kei Truck, the plastic impeller in the water pump and the weak points in the suspension links are prone to failure.

### Safety Warnings
When working on a drift-oriented vehicle, it's crucial to ensure that all modifications are done safely and correctly. Failure to do so can result in damage to the vehicle or injury to the driver.

## Step-by-Step Guide
### Step 1: Engine Modifications
The Kei Truck's engine should be modified to produce more power and torque. This can be achieved by installing a performance air filter, exhaust system, and tuning the engine's computer.
#### Step 1.1: Install Performance Air Filter
Install a high-flow air filter to increase the engine's power output. Ensure that the air filter is compatible with the Kei Truck's engine.
#### Step 1.2: Install Performance Exhaust System
Install a high-performance exhaust system to reduce backpressure and increase the engine's power output. Ensure that the exhaust system is compatible with the Kei Truck's engine.

### Step 2: Suspension Modifications
The Kei Truck's suspension should be modified to handle the stresses of drifting. This can be achieved by installing coilovers, sway bars, and chassis reinforcement.
#### Step 2.1: Install Coilovers
Install coilovers to improve the suspension's damping and stability. Ensure that the coilovers are compatible with the Kei Truck's suspension.
#### Step 2.2: Install Sway Bars
Install sway bars to improve the suspension's stability and reduce body roll. Ensure that the sway bars are compatible with the Kei Truck's suspension.

### Step 3: Drivetrain Modifications
The Kei Truck's drivetrain should be modified to handle the stresses of drifting. This can be achieved by installing a limited-slip differential and reinforcing the drivetrain components.
#### Step 3.1: Install Limited-Slip Differential
Install a limited-slip differential to improve the drivetrain's traction and stability. Ensure that the limited-slip differential is compatible with the Kei Truck's drivetrain.
#### Step 3.2: Reinforce Drivetrain Components
Reinforce the drivetrain components, such as the axles and CV joints, to handle the stresses of drifting.

### Step 4: Brake Modifications
The Kei Truck's brakes should be modified to handle the stresses of drifting. This can be achieved by installing high-performance brake pads and rotors.
#### Step 4.1: Install High-Performance Brake Pads
Install high-performance brake pads to improve the brakes' stopping power and heat resistance. Ensure that the brake pads are compatible with the Kei Truck's brakes.
#### Step 4.2: Install High-Performance Rotors
Install high-performance rotors to improve the brakes' heat resistance and stopping power. Ensure that the rotors are compatible with the Kei Truck's brakes.

## Pro Tips & Common Mistakes
* Don't over-tighten the suspension links, as this can cause damage to the suspension and chassis.
* Ensure that all modifications are done safely and correctly to avoid damage to the vehicle or injury to the driver.
* Use high-quality components and follow proper installation procedures to ensure reliability and performance.

## Cost Analysis: DIY vs Mechanic
The cost of modifying a Kei Truck for drifting can vary depending on the components and labor involved. A DIY approach can save money, but it requires experience and expertise. A mechanic's labor cost can range from $500 to $2,000, depending on the complexity of the modifications.

## Frequently Asked Questions
1. **What is the best engine modification for a Kei Truck?**
