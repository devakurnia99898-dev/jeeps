The symptoms of a malfunctioning hybrid powertrain can be subtle, but some common signs to look out for include:
* Reduced fuel efficiency
* Decreased power output
* Unusual noises or vibrations
* Warning lights on the dashboard

## Technical Deep Dive
The Audi RS5's powertrain consists of a 3.0-liter V6 engine, an electric motor, and a lithium-ion battery pack. The V6 engine produces [insert horsepower and torque values], while the electric motor adds an additional [insert horsepower and torque values]. The battery pack is charged via regenerative braking and an external power source.

The system works by using the electric motor to assist the V6 engine during acceleration, and to power the vehicle at low speeds. The battery pack is charged and discharged as needed to optimize fuel efficiency and performance.

Common failure points in hybrid powertrains include:
* The electric motor's bearings and seals
* The battery pack's cells and management system
* The V6 engine's piston rings and cylinder walls

* Multimeter
* Scan tool
* Lift and jack stands

### Safety Warnings
* Always wear protective gloves and eyewear when working with electrical and hydraulic systems
* Ensure the vehicle is properly supported and secured before starting work
* Never touch electrical components with your bare hands

## Step-by-Step Guide
### Inspecting the Powertrain
#### Visual Inspection
Check the powertrain for any signs of damage or wear, such as leaks, dents, or rust.

#### Using a Scan Tool
Connect a scan tool to the vehicle's OBD-II port to check for any trouble codes or issues.

### Maintaining the V6 Engine
#### Oil Change
1. Warm up the engine by driving the vehicle for a few minutes
2. Locate the oil drain plug and remove it using a 10mm socket
3. Drain the oil into a pan and replace the plug
4. Refill the oil with the recommended type and amount

#### Spark Plug Replacement
1. Locate the spark plugs and remove the ignition coil packs
2. Use a spark plug socket to remove the spark plugs
3. Install new spark plugs and replace the ignition coil packs

### Maintaining the Electric Motor
#### Inspecting the Motor's Bearings and Seals
1. Remove the motor's cover and inspect the bearings and seals for any signs of wear or damage
2. Replace the bearings and seals if necessary

#### Checking the Motor's Electrical Connections
1. Use a multimeter to check the motor's electrical connections for any signs of damage or corrosion
2. Clean or replace the connections as needed

### Maintaining the Battery Pack
#### Checking the Battery Pack's State of Charge
1. Use a scan tool to check the battery pack's state of charge
2. Charge the battery pack if necessary

#### Inspecting the Battery Pack's Cells and Management System
1. Remove the battery pack's cover and inspect the cells and management system for any signs of damage or wear
2. Replace the cells or management system if necessary

## Pro Tips & Common Mistakes
* Always follow the manufacturer's recommended maintenance schedule to avoid premature wear and tear
* Use the correct type and amount of oil for the V6 engine
* Avoid overcharging the battery pack, as this can cause damage to the cells and management system

## Cost Analysis: DIY vs Mechanic
The cost of maintaining a hybrid powertrain can vary depending on the task and the individual's level of expertise. However, here is a rough estimate of the costs involved:
* Oil change: $50 (DIY), $100 (mechanic)
* Brake pad replacement: $200 (DIY), $400 (mechanic)
* Battery pack replacement: $2,000 (DIY), $3,000 (mechanic)

## Frequently Asked Questions
1. Q: How often should I change the oil in my hybrid vehicle?
A: The recommended oil change interval for most hybrid vehicles is every 5,000 to 7,500 miles.
2. Q: Can I use a regular multimeter to check the electric motor's electrical connections?
A: No, a regular multimeter may not be able to handle the high voltages present in the electric motor's electrical connections. A specialized multimeter or scan tool is recommended.
3. Q: How do I know if my battery pack needs to be replaced?
A: If the battery pack's state of charge is consistently low, or if the vehicle is experiencing decreased performance or fuel efficiency, it may be a sign that the battery pack needs to be replaced.
4. Q: Can I replace the spark plugs myself?
A: Yes, replacing the spark plugs is a relatively simple task that can be done at home with the right tools and knowledge.
5. Q: How often should I inspect the powertrain for signs of damage or wear?
A: It is recommended to inspect the powertrain every 12,000 to 15,000 miles, or as recommended by the manufacturer.
