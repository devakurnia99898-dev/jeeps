# The Diagnostic / The Situation
The Nissan Versa is a reliable and affordable sedan, but like any vehicle, it requires regular maintenance to run smoothly. Neglecting maintenance can lead to costly repairs and decreased fuel efficiency. In this guide, we will cover the importance of regular maintenance, common issues to look out for, and provide a comprehensive guide on how to perform routine maintenance tasks.

The Nissan Versa has a reputation for being a low-maintenance vehicle, but it's still important to stay on top of regular maintenance to prevent issues from arising. Some common symptoms of neglected maintenance include decreased fuel efficiency, rough idling, and unusual noises.

## Technical Deep Dive
The Nissan Versa's engine is a 1.6L or 1.8L inline-four cylinder, depending on the model year and trim level. The engine is paired with a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission. The suspension is a MacPherson strut front suspension and a torsion beam rear suspension.

Common failure points on the Nissan Versa include the timing chain, water pump, and brake pads. The timing chain can stretch over time, causing the engine to run rough and potentially leading to costly repairs. The water pump can fail, causing the engine to overheat and potentially leading to engine damage. The brake pads can wear down, causing the brakes to become less effective and potentially leading to accidents.

### Tools Required
* 10mm socket
* 12mm socket
* Torque wrench
* Oil filter wrench
* Tire pressure gauge
* Brake pad wear gauge

### Safety Warnings
* Always wear protective gloves and safety glasses when working with power tools and sharp objects.
* Make sure the vehicle is on a level surface and apply the parking brake before performing any maintenance tasks.
* Never get under the vehicle while it is supported by a jack.

## Step-by-Step Guide
### Oil Change
#### Step 1: Gather materials
Gather the necessary materials, including oil filter wrench, new oil filter, and enough motor oil to fill the engine.

#### Step 2: Warm up the engine
Drive the vehicle for a few minutes to warm up the engine. This will help the oil drain more easily.

#### Step 3: Find a safe place to drain the oil
Find a level surface and make sure the area is clear of any flammable materials.

#### Step 4: Drain the oil
Use a socket wrench to remove the oil drain plug. Let the oil drain completely before replacing the plug.

#### Step 5: Replace the oil filter
Use an oil filter wrench to remove the old oil filter. Dispose of the old filter responsibly. Install a new oil filter and hand tighten it.

#### Step 6: Refill the oil
Pour in the new oil and replace the oil cap. Start the engine and let it run for a few minutes to circulate the new oil.

### Tire Rotation
#### Step 1: Gather materials
Gather the necessary materials, including a tire pressure gauge and a lug wrench.

#### Step 2: Check the tire pressure
Use a tire pressure gauge to check the tire pressure. Compare the pressure to the recommended pressure listed on the tire information placard.

#### Step 3: Rotate the tires
Use a lug wrench to loosen the lug nuts on the first tire. Raise the vehicle using a jack and remove the lug nuts. Rotate the tire to the new position and hand tighten the lug nuts. Repeat for the remaining tires.

#### Step 4: Tighten the lug nuts
Use a torque wrench to tighten the lug nuts in a star pattern. Make sure the lug nuts are tightened to the recommended torque specification.

### Brake Pad Replacement
#### Step 1: Gather materials
Gather the necessary materials, including a brake pad wear gauge and a C-clamp.

#### Step 2: Remove the wheel
Use a lug wrench to loosen the lug nuts on the wheel. Raise the vehicle using a jack and remove the lug nuts. Remove the wheel and set it aside.

#### Step 3: Remove the caliper
Use a socket wrench to remove the caliper bolts. Slide the caliper off the rotor and set it aside.

#### Step 4: Remove the old brake pads
Use a screwdriver to remove the old brake pads. Dispose of the old pads responsibly.

#### Step 5: Install the new brake pads
Install the new brake pads and make sure they are properly seated. Use a C-clamp to compress the caliper piston.

#### Step 6: Reinstall the caliper
Slide the caliper back over the rotor and hand tighten the caliper bolts. Use a torque wrench to tighten the caliper bolts to the recommended torque specification.

## Pro Tips & Common Mistakes
* Always use the correct type of oil for your vehicle. Using the wrong type of oil can cause damage to the engine.
* Never over-tighten the lug nuts. Over-tightening can cause the brake rotor to become warped.
* Always wear protective gloves and safety glasses when working with power tools and sharp objects.

## Cost Analysis: DIY vs Mechanic
The cost of maintaining a Nissan Versa can vary depending on the task. Oil changes and tire rotations are relatively inexpensive and can be done DIY. Brake pad replacement and timing chain replacement are more complex tasks and may require the services of a mechanic.

* Oil change: $50 (DIY), $100 (mechanic)
* Tire rotation: $20 (DIY), $50 (mechanic)
* Brake pad replacement: $200 (DIY), $500 (mechanic)
* Timing chain replacement: $500 (DIY), $1,000 (mechanic)
