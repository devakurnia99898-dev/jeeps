## Introduction to Jeep's Legacy
The Jeep brand has a rich history of producing capable off-road vehicles, with the CJ, YJ, TJ, and JK models being some of the most iconic. The Grand Cherokee, in particular, has been a staple in the lineup, offering a mix of on-road comfort and off-road prowess.

## Historical Context: CJ to JK
The CJ series, introduced in the 1940s, was the first civilian Jeep model. It was followed by the YJ, TJ, and JK models, each with its own set of improvements and advancements. The YJ, introduced in 1986, was the first to feature a more modern design and amenities. The TJ, introduced in 1996, brought a more angular design and improved off-road capabilities. The JK, introduced in 2006, featured a more refined on-road experience while maintaining its off-road chops.

## The Grand Cherokee's Hemi V8
The Grand Cherokee, introduced in 1992, has been a mainstay in the Jeep lineup. It has featured a range of engine options, including the Hemi V8. The Hemi V8, phased out starting in 2023, might be making a return to the lineup. This would be a nod to the brand's heritage and a response to customer demand for a more powerful and capable off-road vehicle.
