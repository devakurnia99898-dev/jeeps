At **VesLife**, trust is our currency. Our editorial process is designed to ensure accuracy, objectivity, and value for our readers.

## 1. Fact-Checking & Accuracy
We take great care to verify technical specifications (horsepower, torque, towing capacity) against official manufacturer data (OEM) and reliable industry sources. If a rumor is reported, it is clearly labeled as "Rumor" or "Speculation," distinct from confirmed news.

## 2. AI & Technology Usage
To maintain a high volume of coverage across the automotive industry, our editorial team utilizes advanced technology, including Artificial Intelligence (AI), to assist in data aggregation, structuring, and initial drafting.

However, **Human Oversight is Mandatory.**
*   Every article is reviewed by our editorial staff (e.g., Dave Harsya) before publication.
*   AI is used as a tool for research assistance, not as a replacement for human judgment and automotive expertise.
*   We fact-check AI-generated drafts against real-world mechanical knowledge.

## 3. Corrections Policy
We are committed to correcting errors promptly. If you believe we have published incorrect information (e.g., wrong engine code for a specific model year), please contact us immediately. We will review the claim and update the article with a correction note if necessary.

## 4. No Pay-for-Play
We do not accept payment in exchange for positive reviews of car parts, accessories, or vehicles. Sponsored content, if ever published, will be clearly marked as "Sponsored" or "Advertisement."
