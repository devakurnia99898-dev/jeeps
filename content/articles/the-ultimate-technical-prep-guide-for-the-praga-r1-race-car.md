Use a 12mm socket to remove the caliper bolts and slide the caliper off the rotor.
#### **Step 2.3: Remove the Old Pads**
Remove the old brake pads and inspect the rotors for wear.
#### **Step 2.4: Install the New Pads**
Install the new brake pads, making sure they are properly seated and the caliper is securely bolted back in place.
### **Step 3: Gearbox Inspection**
#### **Step 3.1: Remove the Gearbox Cover**
Remove the gearbox cover to access the internals.
#### **Step 3.2: Inspect the Synchros**
Inspect the synchros for wear and damage, replacing them if necessary.
