## The Diagnostic / The Situation
Restoring a classic car like the Stutz requires a deep understanding of its history, mechanics, and design. The Stutz was a luxury car brand that originated in the 1910s and was known for its high-performance vehicles. The 1930s models, in particular, are highly sought after by collectors and enthusiasts. However, restoring a vintage Stutz can be a daunting task, especially for those without experience. It's essential to identify the symptoms of a classic car in need of restoration, such as worn-out upholstery, rusty body panels, and outdated engine components.

## Technical Deep Dive
The Stutz Blackhawk, a model from the 1970s, is a revival of the 1930s name on a modern frame. It features a General Motors chassis, a Pontiac Grand Prix engine, and a unique, hand-built body design. The engine is a 7.5L V8, producing 400 horsepower. The transmission is a three-speed automatic, and the car has a rear-wheel drive layout. Common failure points in these classic cars include the plastic impeller in the water pump, the rubber seals in the engine, and the electrical wiring.
