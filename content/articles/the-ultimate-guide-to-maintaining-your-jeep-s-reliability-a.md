Jeep's are known for their ruggedness and off-road capabilities, but like any vehicle, they require regular maintenance to keep them running smoothly. Common symptoms of neglecting maintenance include decreased fuel efficiency, reduced power, and increased risk of breakdowns. By understanding the technical background of your Jeep's systems, you can identify potential issues before they become major problems.

## Technical Deep Dive
Jeep's reliability is dependent on several key systems, including the engine, transmission, suspension, and electrical systems. The engine, for example, relies on a complex system of fuel injectors, spark plugs, and piston rings to function properly. The transmission, on the other hand, uses a combination of gears, bearings, and seals to transmit power to the wheels.

Common failure points in Jeep's include the water pump, alternator, and suspension components. The plastic impeller in the water pump, for example, can fail over time, causing the engine to overheat. Similarly, the alternator can fail, leaving you stranded with a dead battery.

## Pre-Work Checklist
