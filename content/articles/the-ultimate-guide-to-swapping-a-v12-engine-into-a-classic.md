## The Diagnostic / The Situation
The Datsun 240Z is a classic sports car that has been a favorite among car enthusiasts for decades. However, its original engine may not provide the power and performance that some owners desire. One solution to this problem is to swap the original engine with a more powerful V12 engine, such as the M120 Mercedes-Benz V12. This engine swap can provide a significant increase in power and performance, but it also requires careful planning and execution.

Symptoms or signs that a V12 engine swap may be necessary include a lack of power or performance, particularly when accelerating or climbing hills. Additionally, some owners may simply want to upgrade their engine for the sake of novelty or to make their vehicle stand out from others.

## Technical Deep Dive
The M120 Mercedes-Benz V12 engine is a 5.8-liter engine that produces 394 horsepower and 420 lb-ft of torque. It is a compact engine that fits perfectly in the engine bay of the Datsun 240Z, making it an ideal choice for an engine swap. The engine features a dual overhead camshaft design, with 24 valves and a compression ratio of 10.5:1.

Common failure points in the M120 engine include the timing chain tensioners, which can fail if not properly maintained, and the oil pump, which can fail if the engine is not properly warmed up before driving. Additionally, the engine's cooling system can be prone to leaks, particularly in the radiator and hoses.

### Safety Warnings
* Always wear protective gear, including gloves, safety glasses, and a face mask, when working with power tools and welding equipment.
* Make sure the vehicle is properly supported by jack stands and that the parking brake is engaged before starting work.
* Never work under a vehicle that is supported only by a jack.

## Step-by-Step Guide
### Step 1: Prepare the Vehicle
The first step in swapping the engine is to prepare the vehicle. This includes removing the original engine, transmission, and exhaust system. The engine and transmission can be removed as a single unit, using an engine hoist and transmission jack.

#### Step 1.1: Remove the Original Engine
To remove the original engine, start by disconnecting the battery and removing the air intake system. Next, remove the engine mounts and transmission crossmember. Finally, use an engine hoist to lift the engine and transmission out of the engine bay.

#### Step 1.2: Remove the Original Transmission
Once the engine and transmission are removed, use a transmission jack to separate the transmission from the engine. Remove the transmission mounts and crossmember, and then use the transmission jack to lower the transmission to the ground.

#### Step 1.3: Remove the Original Exhaust System
The original exhaust system can be removed by disconnecting the exhaust pipes from the engine and transmission. Use a wrench to loosen the exhaust pipe flanges, and then use a pry bar to remove the exhaust system from the vehicle.

### Step 2: Install the New Engine
The next step is to install the new engine. This includes installing the engine mounts, transmission crossmember, and exhaust system.

#### Step 2.1: Install the Engine Mounts
To install the engine mounts, start by bolting the engine mounts to the engine block. Next, use a wrench to tighten the engine mount bolts to the specified torque (30 ft-lbs).

#### Step 2.2: Install the Transmission Crossmember
To install the transmission crossmember, start by bolting the crossmember to the transmission. Next, use a wrench to tighten the crossmember bolts to the specified torque (40 ft-lbs).

#### Step 2.3: Install the Exhaust System
To install the exhaust system, start by connecting the exhaust pipes to the engine and transmission. Use a wrench to tighten the exhaust pipe flanges to the specified torque (20 ft-lbs).

### Step 3: Install the New Transmission
The final step is to install the new transmission. This includes installing the transmission mounts and crossmember, and then connecting the transmission to the engine.

#### Step 3.1: Install the Transmission Mounts
To install the transmission mounts, start by bolting the transmission mounts to the transmission. Next, use a wrench to tighten the transmission mount bolts to the specified torque (30 ft-lbs).

#### Step 3.2: Install the Transmission Crossmember
To install the transmission crossmember, start by bolting the crossmember to the transmission. Next, use a wrench to tighten the crossmember bolts to the specified torque (40 ft-lbs).

#### Step 3.3: Connect the Transmission to the Engine
To connect the transmission to the engine, start by connecting the transmission to the engine using the transmission adapter. Use a wrench to tighten the transmission adapter bolts to the specified torque (40 ft-lbs).

## Pro Tips & Common Mistakes
One common mistake that can be made when swapping an engine is to not properly align the engine and transmission. This can cause the engine and transmission to vibrate excessively, leading to premature wear and failure. To avoid this, make sure to properly align the engine and transmission before tightening the engine mounts and transmission crossmember.

Another common mistake is to not properly tighten the engine mount and transmission crossmember bolts. This can cause the engine and transmission to move excessively, leading to premature wear and failure. To avoid this, make sure to tighten the engine mount and transmission crossmember bolts to the specified torque.

## Cost Analysis: DIY vs Mechanic
The cost of swapping an engine can vary depending on the type of engine and transmission being used, as well as the labor costs involved. On average, the cost of swapping an engine can range from $5,000 to $10,000, depending on the complexity of the job and the labor costs involved.

If you choose to do the job yourself, you can save money on labor costs, but you will still need to purchase the necessary parts and tools. The cost of the parts and tools can range from $2,000 to $5,000, depending on the type of engine and transmission being used.

If you choose to hire a mechanic to do the job, you can expect to pay a higher labor cost, but you will not need to purchase the necessary parts and tools. The labor cost can range from $3,000 to $6,000, depending on the complexity of the job and the mechanic's hourly rate.

## Frequently Asked Questions
