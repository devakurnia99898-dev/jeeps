## Technical Deep Dive
The 2027 Kia Telluride is expected to feature a 3.8-liter V6 engine, producing 291 horsepower and 262 lb-ft of torque. The engine will be paired with an 8-speed automatic transmission and available all-wheel drive. The suspension system will likely feature a multi-link rear setup and a MacPherson strut front suspension.

Common failure points in the Kia Telluride include the water pump, timing chain, and engine mounts. The water pump is prone to failure due to the plastic impeller, which can crack or break over time. The timing chain can stretch or jump teeth, causing engine misfires and poor performance. Engine mounts can wear out, leading to vibrations and noise.
