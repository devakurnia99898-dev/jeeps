## Introduction
The automotive world is constantly evolving, with new models and technologies emerging every year. However, this also means that some beloved models will eventually be discontinued. Recently, it was announced that several Jeep models will not make it to 2027. In this article, we'll take a closer look at the models that will be discontinued and what this means for the brand and its fans.
## The Discontinued Models
According to recent reports, the following Jeep models will be discontinued by 2027:
* Jeep Renegade
* Jeep Compass (in some markets)
* Jeep Grand Cherokee WK (in some markets)
These models have been popular among Jeep enthusiasts, but the company has decided to focus on other models and technologies.

It features a 3.6L V6 engine, producing 295 horsepower and 260 lb-ft of torque. The Grand Cherokee WK also has a number of advanced safety features, including blind spot monitoring and rear cross path detection.
## Conclusion
