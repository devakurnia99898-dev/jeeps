## Technical Deep Dive
The Knucklehead engine is a 61 cubic-inch (1000 cc) V-twin engine, featuring a single camshaft operating the valves via a complex system of rocker arms and pushrods. The engine has a 3.44-inch (87.3 mm) bore and a 3.5-inch (88.9 mm) stroke, with a compression ratio of 6.5:1. The engine's unique design, with its articulated rocker arms and valve covers, gives it a distinctive appearance. Common failure points in the Knucklehead engine include the valve train, piston rings, and cylinder walls.

* Piston ring compressor
* Oil filter wrench

### Safety Warnings
* Always wear protective gloves and safety glasses when working with power tools and machinery.
* Ensure the engine is cool before starting any maintenance work.
* Never smoke or have an open flame near the engine, as gasoline and oil can be highly flammable.

## Step-by-Step Guide
### Step 1: Oil Change
#### Step 1.1: Drain the oil
Locate the oil drain plug and remove it using a socket wrench. Allow the oil to drain completely before replacing the plug.
#### Step 1.2: Replace the oil filter
Use an oil filter wrench to remove the old oil filter. Dispose of the old filter responsibly and install a new one.
#### Step 1.3: Refill the oil
Use a high-quality motorcycle oil that meets the specifications of the Knucklehead engine. Fill the engine with the recommended amount of oil, usually around 2-3 quarts.

### Step 2: Valve Adjustment
#### Step 2.1: Remove the valve covers
Use a socket wrench to remove the valve covers. Take note of the location of the spark plug wires and ignition coil.
#### Step 2.2: Adjust the valves
Use a valve adjustment tool to adjust the clearance between the valve stem and the rocker arm. The recommended clearance is 0.004-0.006 inches.
#### Step 2.3: Replace the valve covers
Once the valves are adjusted, replace the valve covers and ensure they are securely fastened.

### Step 3: Piston Ring Replacement
#### Step 3.1: Remove the cylinder head
Use a socket wrench to remove the cylinder head. Take note of the location of the spark plug wires and ignition coil.
#### Step 3.2: Remove the piston
Use a piston ring compressor to remove the piston from the cylinder. Take care not to damage the cylinder walls.
#### Step 3.3: Replace the piston rings
Install new piston rings, ensuring they are properly seated and aligned.
#### Step 3.4: Replace the piston
Use a piston ring compressor to replace the piston, ensuring it is properly seated and aligned.

## Pro Tips & Common Mistakes
* Always use high-quality replacement parts to ensure the longevity of the engine.
* Never over-tighten the valve covers, as this can damage the engine.
* Use a torque wrench to ensure the correct torque specs are applied to the engine components.
* Don't neglect regular maintenance, as this can lead to costly repairs down the road.
