## Technical Deep Dive
The Jeep's engine, suspension, and electrical systems work together to provide a smooth and satisfying drive. The engine, whether it's a 3.6L V6 or a 2.0L turbocharged I4, relies on proper maintenance to function efficiently. The suspension system, including the shocks, struts, and control arms, plays a critical role in handling and stability. The electrical system, comprising the battery, alternator, and wiring, powers the vehicle's accessories and controls. Common failure points include the water pump, serpentine belt, and spark plugs.

* Ensure the vehicle is on a level surface and apply the parking brake
* Never work under a lifted vehicle without proper support

## Step-by-Step Guide
### Oil Change
The oil change is a crucial maintenance task that should be performed every 5,000 to 7,500 miles. To do this, you will need to:
#### Gather materials
* Oil filter wrench
* New oil filter
* Oil drain pan
* New motor oil
#### Locate the oil drain plug
* Underneath the Jeep, you will find the oil drain plug located near the front of the engine
* Use a 10mm socket to remove the plug
#### Drain the oil
* Allow the oil to drain into the pan for at least 10 minutes
* Replace the plug and tighten to 30 ft-lbs
#### Replace the oil filter
* Use an oil filter wrench to remove the old filter
* Install a new oil filter and hand tighten

### Tire Rotation
Tire rotation is essential to ensure even tread wear and extend the life of your tires. To rotate your tires, you will need to:
#### Gather materials
* Tire pressure gauge
* Lug wrench
* Wheel chocks
#### Loosen the lug nuts
* Before you jack up the vehicle, loosen the lug nuts on the first wheel using a lug wrench
* Turn them counterclockwise until they are loose, but do not remove them yet
#### Raise the vehicle
* Use a jack to lift the vehicle until the wheel is off the ground
* Use wheel chocks to secure the wheel and prevent it from rolling
#### Remove the wheel
* Completely remove the lug nuts and take off the wheel
* Repeat this process for the remaining wheels

### Brake Pad Replacement
Brake pad replacement is a more complex task that requires specialized tools and expertise. To replace your brake pads, you will need to:
#### Gather materials
* New brake pads
* Brake pad spreader
* C-clamps
#### Remove the caliper
* Use a wrench to loosen the caliper bolts
* Slide the caliper off the rotor and suspend it using a wire
#### Remove the old brake pads
* Use a screwdriver to remove the old brake pads from the caliper
* Take note of the pad wear sensor wire and disconnect it
#### Install the new brake pads
* Insert the new brake pads into the caliper
* Reconnect the pad wear sensor wire

## Pro Tips & Common Mistakes
* Always refer to your owner's manual for specific maintenance recommendations
* Use the correct type of oil for your Jeep's engine
* Avoid over-tightening the lug nuts, as this can damage the wheel or brake rotor
* Never neglect to replace the oil filter, as this can cause premature engine wear
