## The Diagnostic / The Situation
The Audi RS5 Avant is a high-performance wagon that boasts a powerful engine and sleek design. However, its cargo area is smaller than expected, which can be a challenge for owners who need to transport large items. As a Master Jeep Mechanic and Off-road Engineer, I will provide a comprehensive guide on how to maximize the cargo space in the Audi RS5 Avant.

The symptoms of limited cargo space in the Audi RS5 Avant include:
* Difficulty fitting large items such as luggage, sports equipment, or tools
* Limited vertical space due to the sloping roofline
* Inability to utilize the full potential of the cargo area

## Technical Deep Dive
The Audi RS5 Avant's cargo area is designed to provide a balance between space and style. The rear seats can be folded down to increase the cargo capacity, but the resulting floor is not entirely flat. The cargo area is also equipped with tie-down points, a cargo net, and a storage compartment under the floor.

Common failure points that can affect the cargo space include:
* The rear seats' folding mechanism can become stuck or worn out over time
* The cargo net can become damaged or loose, reducing its effectiveness
* The storage compartment under the floor can become cluttered or damaged, reducing its usability
