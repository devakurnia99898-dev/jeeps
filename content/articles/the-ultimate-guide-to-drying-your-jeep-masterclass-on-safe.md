## Technical Deep Dive
The paint and trim on your Jeep are sensitive to scratches, abrasions, and damage from high-pressure air flows. When using a leaf blower to dry your Jeep, you risk dislodging loose debris, creating scratches, and damaging the paint and trim. Additionally, the high-velocity air flow can force water into tight spaces, such as door seals, window seals, and trim gaps, leading to water damage and rust.

Common failure points to consider when drying your Jeep include:

* Paint scratches and abrasions
* Trim damage and dislodgement
* Water damage and rust in tight spaces
* Door and window seal damage
