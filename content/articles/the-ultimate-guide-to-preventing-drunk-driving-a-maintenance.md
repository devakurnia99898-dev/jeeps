# The Diagnostic / The Situation
As a Master Jeep Mechanic and Off-road Engineer, I understand the importance of maintaining a vehicle's safety features to prevent accidents. The recent news about a drunk-driving cop hitting a house and killing two dogs is a stark reminder of the dangers of drunk driving. In this guide, we will focus on the technical aspects of preventing drunk driving and maintaining a Jeep's safety features.

Drunk driving is a serious issue that affects not only the driver but also their loved ones and the community at large. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), drunk driving claims thousands of lives every year. As a Jeep owner, it is essential to take proactive steps to prevent drunk driving and ensure your vehicle is in good working condition.
