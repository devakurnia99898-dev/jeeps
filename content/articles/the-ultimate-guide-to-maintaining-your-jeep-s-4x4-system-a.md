## Technical Deep Dive
The 4x4 system in a Jeep consists of several key components, including the transfer case, front and rear axles, and driveshafts. The transfer case is responsible for splitting power between the front and rear axles, while the axles themselves are designed to withstand the stresses of off-road driving. Common failure points in the 4x4 system include:
* The plastic impeller in the water pump
* The bearings in the front and rear axles
* The seals in the transfer case

Understanding how these components work together is crucial for maintaining and repairing your Jeep's 4x4 system.
